A WordPress plugin containing a Gutenberg Block called "First Block", which pulls user information from jsonplaceholder. 

== Description ==


This project includes a custom WordPress plugin containing a Gutenberg Block called "First Block". I created the plugin following a Youtube course, and then added additional functionality for educational purposes. 

First Block pulls user information from jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.

This project was completed in order to familiarize myself with Gutenberg block development.
